I’m excited to share the recent workshop I conducted on **Attacking JWT**, which focuses on understanding and exploiting common security issues in **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**—a core authentication mechanism used in modern web applications.

JWTs are widely adopted in APIs, single-page applications, mobile apps, and microservices. While they are designed to be secure and scalable, **misconfigurations and poor implementation choices can lead to critical security vulnerabilities**.


## Attacking JWTs
The repository provides hands-on examples of practical JWT attack techniques, such as:

- **Algorithm Confusion Attacks** (switching between RS256 and HS256)  
- **Brute-forcing JWT secrets**  
- **Token tampering and claim manipulation**  
- **Exploiting None algorithm vulnerabilities**  
- **Abusing weak or leaked signing keys**  

---
JWTs themselves are not insecure—but **misconfigured JWT implementations are a common cause of severe security breaches**. The **Attacking JWT** repository serves as a practical guide to understanding how JWT vulnerabilities arise and how they can be exploited in real-world scenarios.
