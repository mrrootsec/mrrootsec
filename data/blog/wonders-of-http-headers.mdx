# Introduction

السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ

Hello everyone! I am excited to share the recent session I presented on the fascinating world of HTTP headers at NULL Hyderabad meetup on January 20, 2024.

This session covers the basics of HTTP headers such as Host, User-Agent, Referer, Origin, Message body information( Content-Type, Content-Encoding), Cache, Location Change(X-Forwarded-, X-Host, X-Remote-) etc. and their importance, how they can be vulnerable. We'll look at different situations like errors in responses, incorrect settings, and conflicts in settings, to see how they can be exploited. Additionally, we'll discuss remediation's and measures to protect against these vulnerabilities.

During the session, I provided several resources to help attendees dive deeper into the topic, including slides and additional reading materials. You can find the slides [Wonders of HTTP Headers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pR-_dNq9zAgMH1tJv6diPFqEYtNY3fopzJnaiiT-j6A/edit?usp=sharing).

Stay curious and keep learning! 🙌
