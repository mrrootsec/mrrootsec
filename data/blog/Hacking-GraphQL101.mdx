السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share the recent presentation I gave on Hacking GraphQL 101 - Exploring & Exploiting Vulnerabilities in GraphQL API's at NULL Hyderabad meetup on Feb 22, 2025. 
In this session, we delved into the GraphQL security such as

**What is GraphQL?** - A brief explanation of GraphQL as a query language and runtime, highlighting the differences from REST APIs.

**Terminology of GraphQL** - Introduced core concepts like Query, Mutation, Subscription, and Resolver, which are fundamental to understanding GraphQL.

**Discovery of GraphQL** - Techniques to find GraphQL APIs, which is crucial for penetration testers and security researchers.

**Finding Misconfigurations** - Covered both manual and automated approaches to identify common issues in GraphQL APIs, including overly permissive schemas and weak authorization.

**Pentesting GraphQL APIs** - A practical guide to pentesting GraphQL APIs, focusing on exploiting misconfigurations and weak access control.

**Hardening GraphQL APIs** - A list of best practices to secure GraphQL APIs, which can be implemented by developers to prevent security issues.
