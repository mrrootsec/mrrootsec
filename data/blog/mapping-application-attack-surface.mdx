السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share the recent presentation I gave on uncovering vulnerabilities by exploring application attack surfaces at NULL Hyderabad meetup on May 25, 2024. In this session, we delved into the world of application security, discussing practical techniques such as

** Reconnaissance Techniques:** We explored practical methods for gathering information about applications, including understanding how they're structured and what potential weaknesses might exist.

** Analyzing Attack Surfaces:** We discussed different ways to examine an application's "attack surface," which is essentially the points where it could be vulnerable to attack. This involved looking at things like how data is stored and accessed, as well as potential weak spots in authentication and authorization mechanisms.

** Identifying Entry Points:** We talked about various ways attackers might try to exploit vulnerabilities once they've found them, such as exploiting misconfigurations or weaknesses in how the application handles user input.
