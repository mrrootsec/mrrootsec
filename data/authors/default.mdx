Assalamualaikum! I'm Mohammad Saqlain. I work as an Application Security Engineer.
I spend my days hacking applications for weak spots, testing them to see if they can be broken into, and then fixing these problems to keep everything safe. I really like keeping up with the latest in cyber security. It's important to me to always be learning new things so I can be better at my job.
I also enjoy being an occasional bug bounty hunter. This means I sometimes look for security flaws in bug bounty programs, which helps me learn more.
Besides working with computers, I work with people too. I explain security stuff in a way that's easy to understand and help people to make our applications as safe as they can be.
